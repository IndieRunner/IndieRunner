# Status Tracker

This will be updated as best as possible, but with the ever-shifting tectonic plates of runtime and libraries, breakage of some games may go undetected for a while.

All the games listed here have been shown to run. If one of them isn't running, it is a bug. Open a GitHub issue if you have updates on something working or not working.

Letters indicate which platform versions have been tested successfully:

* L: Linux
* W: Windows
* M: MacOS
* X: Other (e.g. platform-independent like mygame.love)
